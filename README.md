# DHT Sensor Library - by Nexon

This is my customized version of the DHT sensor library for Arduino, based on the Adafruit DHT library.

## Features
- Supports DHT11, DHT22, DHT21 sensors.
- Easy to use with example sketches.
- Compatible with most Arduino boards.

## My Contribution
I updated and repackaged this library for easier use and sharing via GitHub and GitHub Pages.

## How to Use
1. Download the ZIP from [Releases](https://github.com/nexonshimwa/DHT-sensor-library-master-by-nexon/releases).
2. In Arduino IDE, go to **Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...**
3. Select the downloaded ZIP and start coding!
